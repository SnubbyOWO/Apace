## Common Errors & Troubleshooting

### I cannot see the "Start Server" button when logged in

**Cause:** Only the very first account created on the launcher is granted full administrative permissions by default. Subsequent accounts lack the necessary privileges to manage the server.

**Solutions:**

* **Option A (Grant Permissions):** Log into the original (first) account and use the Manage Users/Roles page to grant server permissions to your second account.
* **Option B (Reset Database):** If you have lost access to the first account and need to start fresh, you can reset the user database.
  * Navigate to: `launcher/Data/`
  * **Delete** the `app.db` file.
  * *Note: This will remove all existing accounts and allow you to register a new primary admin account.*

### When I open the app, I get "Cannot connect to the network! ..."

**Possible causes**:

* Server is not running
* Incorrect PC IP address
* Firewall blocks the server
* PC and phone are not on the same network

### The app closes when I join a buildplate

**Possible causes**:

* The server took too long to start - quickly open the app and join the same buildplate again
* You do not have Java 17 installed - check that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to Java 17, or that `java --version` prints java 17
