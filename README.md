Really fast replacement server for Minecraft Earth™, based on [Solace](https://github.com/Earth-Restored/Solace) with additional features and fixes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Active development.** Server is functional — maps, buildplates, challenges, daily rewards, adventures, crafting, and more are working. Performance improvements planned.

## Installation

For installation instructions, refer to [Installation.md](Installation.md)

## Migrating from Solace

If you already have Solace running, copy your persistent data to Apace:

```powershell
# 1. Stop both servers first
# 2. Copy data directories
Copy-Item -Path "C:\path\to\Solace\launcher\Data\*" -Destination "C:\path\to\Apace\launcher\Data\" -Recurse
Copy-Item -Path "C:\path\to\Solace\launcher\config.json" -Destination "C:\path\to\Apace\launcher\config.json"
Copy-Item -Path "C:\path\to\Solace\staticdata\*" -Destination "C:\path\to\Apace\staticdata\" -Recurse

# 3. Start Apace — accounts, buildplates, and settings are preserved
```

> [!TIP]
> The database (`app.db`) and `config.json` are fully compatible between Solace and Apace. Static data (resourcepacks, world templates) should also be copied over.

## Roadmap

- **Single-server multi-world** — replace one-JVM-per-buildplate with shared Fabric server using multiple dimensions, eliminating cold starts and drastically reducing RAM usage
- **World preloading & pooling** — keep idle instances warm so players join instantly
- **Unified port routing** — serve all buildplates through a single port instead of one per instance

## Common Errors & Troubleshooting

### I cannot see the "Start Server" button when logged in

**Cause:** Only the very first account created on the launcher is granted full administrative permissions by default. Subsequent accounts lack the necessary privileges to manage the server.

**Solutions:**

* **Option A (Grant Permissions):** Log into the original (first) account and use the Manage Users/Roles page to grant server permissions to your second account.
* **Option B (Reset Database):** If you have lost access to the first account and need to start fresh, you can reset the user database.
  * Navigate to: `launcher/Data/`
  * **Delete** the `app.db` file.
  * *Note: This will remove all existing accounts and allow you to register a new primary admin account.*

### When I open the app, I get "Cannot connect to the network! ..."

**Possible causes**:

* Server is not running
* Incorrect PC IP address
* Firewall blocks the server
* PC and phone are not on the same network

### The app closes when I join a buildplate

**Possible causes**:

* The server took too long to start - quickly open the app and join the same buildplate again
* You do not have Java 17 installed - check that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to Java 17, or that `java --version` prints java 17
